gmsv_floodgate
==============

Mitigates many server lag exploits based on spamming some kind of console message.

To use it, require the module and then call the ConsoleFloodgate(x) function every so often to allow x more messages to print to the console.

Compiled DLL and lua for your server is in release. For the version I compiled, you'll need vcruntime140.dll in your server folder (alongside srcds.exe)

Lots of code used from gm_spew: https://github.com/LennyPenny/gm_spew
(based on my tests, using a hook with gm_spew doesn't prevent lag exploits, but this module does)
